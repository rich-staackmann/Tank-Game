Tank-Game
=========

First try at a full game in Unity3D!

I have been following along with the Unity website's tutorial and also youtube tutorials. I decided to strike out
on my own and make a 3D tank game. It's meant to be more arcade-y than realistic.

The idea isn't to make a game to sell, but instead to explore all of unity's subsystems and try to add all the features
that a modern game would have.

After I tidy up this game, I hope to take some stabs at an FPS and an RPG.

All assets are free from the unity store, or from the unity standard assets.
Sounds effect were found on soundbible.com, with credit going to Snottyboy for the tank sounds 
and Mike Koenig for the explosion sound.
