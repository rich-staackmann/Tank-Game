Tank-Game (complete)
====================

First try at a full game in Unity3D!

I have been following along with the Unity website's tutorial and also youtube tutorials. I decided to strike out
on my own and make a 3D tank game. It's meant to be more arcade-y than realistic.

The idea isn't to make a game to sell, but instead to explore all of unity's subsystems and try to add all the features
that a modern game would have.

After I tidy up this game, I hope to take some stabs at an FPS and an RPG.

All assets are free from the unity store, or from the unity standard assets.
Sounds effect were found on soundbible.com, with credit going to Snottyboy for the tank sounds 
and Mike Koenig for the explosion sound.

Current Issues:
1) Even with continuous collsion detection, bullets will still sometimes travel through the terrain.
2) The terrain was built in unity terrain editor, which has caused some imperfections in the mesh.


Final:
I added some rudimentary path following AI for the enemy tank to follow. I have a spawn system in place, but it just
spawns one tank. This project was a nice learning experience but I want to commit my time to other projects.
I put the latest x64 build in the .rar file but this game was really just a prototype for further adventures.
