Tank-Game
=========

First try at a full game in Unity3D!

I have been following along with the Unity website's tutorial and also youtube tutorials. I decided to strike out
on my own and make a 3D tank game. It's meant to be more arcade-y than realistic.

The idea isn't to make a game to sell, but instead to explore all of unity's subsystems and try to add all the features
that a modern game would have.

After I tidy up this game, I hope to take some stabs at an FPS and an RPG.
